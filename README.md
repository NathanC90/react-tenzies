# Tenzies - A React Capstone project from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home)

This my solution to the capstone project Tenzies from [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home).
Styles are followed by the figma design [here](https://www.figma.com/design/9QmYnPL43cALjVBQ0FCecA/Tenzies-(Copy)?node-id=2-31&node-type=frame&t=PFIhhNeaPjG9iKrC-0)

### Skills required
- CSS: Flexbox & Grid & Media query
- Javascript: Array method
- React: useState, useEffect, useRef, npm Confetti
- HTML: aria-live, aria-label for better accessibility

### My thought process
1. Create a Die component and generate 10 random numbers
2. Map array to Die components & create roll dice button
3. Change dice to object so that we can change dice status (is held or not)
4. Import Confetti 
5. Improve accessibility by adding aria-live and aria-label to HTML elements
